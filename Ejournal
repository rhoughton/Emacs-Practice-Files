Productive day here studying git, vi, and emacs at the same time. 
This folder, is an example of the practice I'm going through to use all three.
Many might think I'm crazying mixing emacs and vi, truth is I don't like vi as much.
However, there are a few functions I like such as the backspace not deleting but 
literally being a backspace! Then the overwriting happens. 
Also, I like how some of the keys are the same as on the terminal like ctrl a and e.

-I did have a hiccup, Cent didn't have an active connection and I keep forget the cmd I used that brought me to a gui, but b/c of that I found a new way to activate my connection that is easy to remember! ifup enp0s3
-I could go to the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3 file and change ONBOOT to yes, or I can master this one cmd, then change configurations after the lesson is learned!
-another way I heard, just type in dhclient to attemp to configure all interfaces... I'll tryit next time maybe.

I had a strange occurence, 2 files called .spacemacs one in the home dir and the other in the emacs.d dir so what happened? Well idk... but the one in the home is the right one, I tested this theory by changing the value of the maximize screen on startup to 't' but I also changed a few other packages I was bringing in and now I have a lambda on the screen of my eshell?!!!!??
-green means I'm in insert mode, blue is traditional emacs, and yellow is vim navigation which is my fav b/c I can use the space bar and doulbe spc if I need to get into the c-x realm.
m-w for copy, m-h for highlight all.
