I did all this type in another buffer only to find out that buffer is living inside my profh computer. hm... how to bounce between buffers without this problem? When I visited the new file I didn't type touch, b/c emacs created that new file on it's own. But the bright side is now I can experiment with what happens when I try to commit two new files with the same name via two different user accounts.
